Here's a summary of the Test Platform Example project, detailing implemented features, key architectural points, and undeveloped/requested content for future work:

## Test Platform Example: Project Summary for Handover

**Project Goal:** To create a foundational test platform that supports dynamic plugins and C# scripting for controlling and interacting with these plugins, primarily through a Windows Forms UI.

---

### I. Implemented Features & Components

1. **Core Platform (`CorePlatform` Project - .NET Library)**:
   
   - **Plugin Management (`PluginManager.cs`)**:
     - Dynamically loads plugins (DLLs) at runtime from a designated "Plugins" folder.
     - `IPlugin` interface: Standard interface for all plugins (`Name`, `Description`, `Load()`, `RunTest(Action<string> logCallback)`, `Unload()`).
   - **C# Scripting Engine (`ScriptEngine.cs`)**:
     - Uses Roslyn (`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting`) to compile and execute C# scripts.
     - **`Host` Object for Scripts (`ScriptingHost.cs` via `ScriptGlobals.cs`)**: Exposes a global `Host` object to scripts, providing methods to:
       - Log messages to the main UI and file log (`Host.Log(string)`, `Host.print(object)`).
       - List names of loaded plugins (`Host.ListPluginNames()`).
       - Execute commands on scriptable plugins (`Host.ExecutePluginCommand(pluginName, commandName, parameters)`).
     - **Script Environment Customization**:
       - Supports default assembly references (e.g., System, System.IO, System.Text, System.Linq, System.Collections.Generic, System.Net.Http, System.Threading.Tasks, System.Xml.Linq, System.Diagnostics, CorePlatform itself).
       - Conditionally references `System.Windows.Forms` if the host provides it, allowing scripts to use types like `MessageBox`.
       - Allows your defined additional namespaces and assembly references per script session via the UI.
   - **Scriptable Plugin Interface (`IScriptablePlugin.cs`)**:
     - Extends `IPlugin`.
     - Defines `ExecuteScriptCommand(string commandName, string parameters)` for plugins to expose specific actions to scripts.
     - Defines `string[] GetAvailableScriptCommands()` for plugins to declare their supported script commands.

2. **Sample Plugin (`SamplePlugin` Project - .NET Library)**:
   
   - `MyPlugin.cs` implements `IPlugin` and `IScriptablePlugin`.
   - Demonstrates basic plugin functionality and script command handling (e.g., "GetStatus", "Echo", "Add").
   - Implements `GetAvailableScriptCommands()`.

3. **Windows Forms UI (`WinFormsUI` Project - .NET Windows Forms App)**:
   
   - **Main Window (`MainForm.cs`)**:
     - Loads plugins using `PluginManager`.
     - **Persistent Logging**: All messages sent to the UI's ListBox (`lstLog`) are also synchronously written to `TestPlatformExample.log`.
     - **Embedded Script Editor (Basic)**:
       - A `FastColoredTextBox` (`fctbScriptInput`) for C# script input with syntax highlighting.
       - A "Run Script" button (`btnRunScript`) to execute scripts from this embedded editor using default script settings.
       - This editor's content synchronizes with the standalone `ScriptEditorForm`.
       - Correctly resizes with the main form.
     - Button to launch the standalone `ScriptEditorForm`.
     - Button to launch the `PluginInfoForm`.
   - **Standalone Script Editor (`ScriptEditorForm.cs`)**:
     - Launched modally from `MainForm`.
     - Uses `FastColoredTextBox` for C# editing with syntax highlighting, line numbers.
     - **Full IDE Features**:
       - File operations: New, Open, Save, Save As (with unsaved changes prompts).
       - Script execution ("Run Script") via `ScriptEngine`.
       - Syntax checking ("Check Syntax") via `ScriptEngine`.
       - Status bar for messages.
     - **Script Settings UI**: "Script Settings..." menu item opens `ScriptSettingsForm` to manage custom namespaces and assembly references for the current script editor session. These settings are used by `ScriptEngine`.
     - **Help Menu**: "Scripting Guide..." item opens `HelpForm`.
   - **Help Window (`HelpForm.cs`)**:
     - Displays `SCRIPTING_PLATFORM_GUIDE.md` (as plain text).
     - *(Intended, but currently blocked by an issue):* Lists example C# scripts (from `temp_scripts` files) in a TreeView and displays selected script code in a `FastColoredTextBox`.
     - *(Intended, but not yet implemented):* "Copy Script" button.
   - **Plugin Information Window (`PluginInfoForm.cs`)**:
     - Launched from `MainForm`.
     - Lists all loaded plugins.
     - Displays details for a selected plugin: Name, Description, .NET Type, Assembly.
     - If a plugin is scriptable (implements `IScriptablePlugin`), it lists its available script commands (from `GetAvailableScriptCommands()`).
   - **Temporary Example Scripts (`temp_scripts` directory)**:
     - Contains `.cs.txt` files that `HelpForm` is designed to load as examples. This directory and its files are part of the project.

4. **Documentation**:
   
   - `README_Example.md`: Overview of the example project, its features, and how to run it.
   - `SCRIPTING_PLATFORM_GUIDE.md`: Detailed guide on C# scripting features, `Host` API, script settings, Help window.
   - `PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE_CN.md`: Guide in Chinese for developing plugins, including making them scriptable.

### II. Key Architectural Points

- **Modular Plugin Architecture**: Decouples core platform from specific functionalities. Plugins are loaded dynamically.
- **Roslyn-Based C# Scripting**: Provides powerful and flexible scripting capabilities.
- **Centralized Logging**: `MainForm.LogMessage` serves as a central point for UI and file logging.
- **Dedicated UI Forms**: Separate forms for script editing, help, plugin info, and script settings provide a structured user experience.
- **Event-Driven and Callback Mechanisms**: Used for UI updates and communication (e.g., `ScriptingHost` logging).

### III. Undeveloped / Recently Requested Features (for Future AI)

1. **Python Scripting Support (Major New Feature)**:
   - Requirement: Support Python as a second scripting language.
   - Tasks: Research and integrate a Python engine (e.g., IronPython, Python.NET). Adapt `ScriptEngine` and `ScriptingHost`. Modify `ScriptEditorForm` for language selection and Python syntax highlighting. Create Python documentation and examples. Update `HelpForm` for Python examples.
2. **New Cobot Plugin (Major New Feature)**:
   - Requirement: Plugin for collaborative robot status and control via Modbus TCP.
   - Tasks: Research/select Modbus TCP library. Design and implement `CobotPlugin.cs` (implementing `IPlugin`, `IScriptablePlugin`). Define and implement scriptable commands for Cobot control (register access). Add specific documentation and examples.
3. **Enhancements to Plugin Information UI**:
   - Your feedback "新增一个界面，用于展示已经加载的插件列表，点击其中一个插件后，可以展示插件的主要功能、支持的调用函数和接口等信息" implies the current `PluginInfoForm` (which shows Name, Desc, Type, Assembly, Scriptable Status, Script Commands) might be a good start, but "主要功能" (main functions) and "接口" (interfaces) could be interpreted more broadly.
   - Tasks: Consider if more detailed reflection or attribute-based systems are needed to expose more about a plugin's internal structure or non-script methods in a user-friendly way. This is an extension of the existing `PluginInfoForm`.
4. **Advanced Script Editor UI Features (from earlier feedback, lower priority than above)**:
   - More "friendly programming interface" beyond syntax highlighting/line numbers for `ScriptEditorForm` (e.g., basic code completion - very complex).
   - Script File Management in `ScriptEditorForm` (e.g., recent files list, tabs for multiple scripts - complex).

---

### IV. Outstanding Minor Tasks / Bugs from Current C# Scripting Work

1. **Complete `HelpForm.cs` (CRITICAL for C# Help Usability)**:
   - **Embed and Display Example C# Scripts**: Successfully load and display the 5 example C# scripts from the `temp_scripts` files into the `HelpForm`'s TreeView and viewer. This was previously blocked by my inability to correctly format the C# array definition when trying to hardcode them; the file-based approach (for which I did implement the file-reading logic) should now work and needs to be tested.
   - **Implement "Copy Script" Button**: Wire up this button in `HelpForm` to copy the displayed example script to the clipboard.
2. **Thorough Manual Testing**: All implemented C# features (scripting, UI interactions, settings, help, plugin info) need comprehensive manual testing in a Windows environment.
3. **Final Documentation Polish**: After all C# features are tested and the HelpForm examples are working, give all documentation a final review for accuracy and completeness regarding the C# functionality.

This summary should provide a good starting point for any AI continuing this project. The immediate next steps should be to complete the C# HelpForm (examples and copy button) and then proceed with the new major features as prioritized by you (Python, then Cobot plugin).
